I sit on a treasure but do not own it, my claws are sharp, but I do not hunt. What am I?
I soar without wings, I see without eyes. I've traveled the universe without leaving the sky. What am I?
Older than time, more patient than stone, I stand in the open but travel alone. What am I?
Bright as gold, but it is not gold; given away, but never sold. Sought by many, found by few. What am I?
I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?
I am not alive, yet I grow; I don't have lungs, yet I need air; I don't have a mouth, yet water kills me. What am I?
You see me once in June, twice in November, but not at all in May. What am I?
I dance without legs, I sing without a voice, I am nowhere but seen everywhere. What am I?
I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, rivers but no water. What am I?
What flies without wings, cries without eyes, and flutters but never goes anywhere?
